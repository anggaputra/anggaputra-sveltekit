<p class="mt-10 mb-5">I'm Angga. Designer, Prototyper & Maker.</p>
<p><b class="text-muted">A bit about me</b></p>
<p>
	I've been designing for digital products since 2009 (UI/UX). Currently, I'm focusing more into
	interaction design and specializing in design system, tooling and prototyping. Combining design
	with technical expertise (front-end).
	<br /><br />I'm a designer who loves to code, when I worked for a design studio in my early
	career, I also learned how to build the HTML/CSS version of my designs, from there I build my
	enthusiasm through technical things, especially front-end development, from the web to mobile app
	development.
</p>
<p>
	Years of experience in e-commerce, C2C marketplace, and B2B/B2C SaaS platform. I've been working
	for small to large scale product companies, as the only designer, team leader, or individual
	contributor.

<p>
	I'm using lean UX methodology most of the time, experiment first as my design philosophy. It's
	what I believe most, at the end of the day you need to ship your product and see how it goes while
	real users interact with it.
